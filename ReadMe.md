# Superhero-Team-Dueler
Ever wondered which of your favorite super heroes would win in a fight? Team them up for battle in this introduction to object oriented programming.

## Key Terms
### Page 1 Object-Oriented Programming: Dogs
- **Instantiation** - the process of creating an object in memory from the class definition

### Page 2 Build Ability and Hero Classes
- **Constructor** - allows us to add a property to the class upon initialization. 
                `__init__` is a special method called a constructor that runs whenever a new instance of a class is created

### Page 3 Instance
- **Inheritance** - allows us for additional ways to reuse code
- **superclass** - the parent class
- **subclass** - a child class that inherited a superclass and all of its parent's properties and methods
- **Polymorphism** - allows us to use different implementations of the same method
- __Method overriding__ - a form of polymorphism which and specify/redefine/override a different functionality for methods that are inherited from the superclass
- __Test Driven Development (TDD)__ - is another way of imagining the end result before you dive into coding
                                    - concept of writing code that verifies the behaviors we want our program to perform


## New codes
- ```if isinstance(object, str): //checks if object is a string data type```
