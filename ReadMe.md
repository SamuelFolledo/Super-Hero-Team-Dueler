# Superhero-Team-Dueler
Ever wondered which of your favorite super heroes would win in a fight? Team them up for battle in this introduction to object oriented programming.

## Key Terms
### 1. OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING: DOGS
- **Instantiation** - the process of creating an object in memory from the class definition

### 2. BUILD ABILITY AND HERO CLASSES
- **Constructor** - allows us to add a property to the class upon initialization. 
                `__init__` is a special method called a constructor that runs whenever a new instance of a class is created

### 3. INSTANCE
- **Inheritance** - allows us for additional ways to reuse code
- **superclass** - the parent class
- **subclass** - a child class that inherited a superclass and all of its parent's properties and methods
- **Polymorphism** - allows us to use different implementations of the same method
- __Method overriding__ - a form of polymorphism which and specify/redefine/override a different functionality for methods that are inherited from the superclass
- __Test Driven Development (TDD)__ - is another way of imagining the end result before you dive into coding
                                    - concept of writing code that verifies the behaviors we want our program to perform

### 4. TEAM ATTACK AND DEFENSE

### 5. SUPERHERO TEAM DUELER


## __Codes__
- ```if isinstance(object, str):    //checks if object is a string data type```
- ```random.randint(begin, start)   //select random int from begin to start```
- ```random.choice(array)           //select random element from the array```
